/**
 * Skillify contracts + seams — PRD-016 Wave 1 (the typed shapes 016a / 016b / 016c
 * all code against).
 *
 * Skillify mines recurring session patterns, crystallizes a reusable `SKILL.md`,
 * and propagates it to the team. The pipeline has three sub-PRDs that meet ONLY at
 * these contracts:
 *
 *   - 016a (trace miner, `miner.ts`) — trigger + lock + session fetch + pair
 *     extraction + the gate-CLI shell-out. PRODUCES a {@link GateVerdict} over a
 *     batch of {@link MinedPair}s.
 *   - 016b (skills writes, `skills-write.ts` + `watermark.ts`, THIS WAVE, FULL) —
 *     CONSUMES a verdict: writes the `SKILL.md` + an APPEND-ONLY version row into the
 *     existing `skills` table, advances the watermark.
 *   - 016c (skill install, `install.ts`) — pull + auto-pull + symlink fan-out.
 *     CONSUMES 016b's append-only rows (reads highest-version-per-(name,author)).
 *
 * ── The two non-negotiable invariants every seam encodes ─────────────────────
 *   1. APPEND-ONLY, VERSION-BUMPED writes. b-AC-1 LITERALLY requires "a new version
 *      row, never an in-place UPDATE." The active skill for a logical id is its
 *      HIGHEST-version row, resolved poll-convergently (a single read under-reports
 *      on the live backend). This is the SAME mechanic `memory_jobs`,
 *      `ontology/supersede.ts`, and `sources/lifecycle.ts` all proved live.
 *   2. THE HOOK SIGNALS THE DAEMON; THE DAEMON OWNS THE ONLY DEEPLAKE CONNECTION.
 *      016b runs INSIDE the daemon, so its storage seam IS the daemon-side
 *      {@link SkillStore} (a thin wrapper over `StorageQuery`). A skills write never
 *      re-opens DeepLake — it goes through the storage path the daemon already holds
 *      (b-AC-6). The hook half (016a's trigger) lives on the thin-client side and
 *      signals the daemon over port 3850; it is OUT of 016b's scope.
 *
 * ── Boundary vs interior (where zod lives) ──────────────────────────────────
 * The shapes 016a BUILDS ({@link MinedPair}, {@link GateVerdict}) and 016b WRITES
 * ({@link Skill}, {@link SkillProvenance}) are plain TS interfaces — they are
 * constructed in-process from already-trusted data, so a runtime re-validation would
 * be ceremony (mirrors `sources/contracts.ts` + `ontology/contracts.ts`). zod
 * validates at the UNTRUSTED boundary (the CLI / API config), which 016a/016c own.
 *
 * Every value these contracts carry is eventually interpolated into SQL by
 * `skills-write.ts` through the `sqlStr` / `sLiteral` / `val.*` helpers — the
 * contracts hold the data, the writer escapes it.
