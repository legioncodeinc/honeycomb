/**
 * The structured `/health` detail contract — PRD-029 Wave 1 (AC-2 / AC-3 / D-2..D-5).
 *
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * ADDITIVE, BACKWARD-COMPATIBLE (D-3). The coarse {@link PipelineStatus} bit
 * (`ok`/`degraded`/`unconfigured`) and its every existing consumer (`/api/status`,
 * the connectivity banner, the 503 gate in `server.ts`) are UNCHANGED. This module
 * adds a per-subsystem `reasons` block that NAMES which subsystem is down — storage,
 * embeddings, schema — so a degraded daemon stops looking healthy with no WHY (the
 * live-dogfood pain this PRD surfaces). The `reasons` are NEW fields layered on the
 * SAME cached health bit; no new probe is introduced (D-4).
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── No secret, by construction (D-5) ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * Every field here is a SUBSYSTEM NAME + a coarse STATE enum (`reachable`/`on`/`ok`…).
 * There is no token, endpoint credential, org GUID, header value, or URL in any field
 * — the same redaction posture `RequestLogRecord` and the SQL tracer already enforce.
 * The shape is a closed set of string literals, so a value can NEVER carry a secret.
 *
 * ── Where each reason comes from (D-4: read the already-cached state) ─────────
 *   - `storage`     ← the coarse pipeline bit the `refreshHealth` `SELECT 1` probe
 *                     maintains (`assemble.ts`). `ok` → reachable; anything else →
 *                     unreachable. No new round-trip; we read the cached bit.
 *   - `embeddings`  ← the embed-seam state KNOWN AT ASSEMBLY (the no-op vs real embed
 *                     client, ledger D-4). `on` when the real embedder is wired,
 *                     `off` for the no-op / explicit `HONEYCOMB_EMBEDDINGS=false`.
 *   - `schema`      ← best-effort: `ok` unless a REQUIRED table is known-missing. With
 *                     no cheap always-on signal at the health seam, this stays `ok`
 *                     (conservative — never a false "missing_table"); a caller that
 *                     HAS a known-missing signal passes `missing_table` explicitly.
 *
 * ── Mode-gating lives at the CALLER, not here (D-2 / AC-3) ────────────────────
 * This module is the pure contract + builder. WHICH surface exposes `reasons` is the
 * caller's call: `server.ts` `/health` includes `reasons` in `local` mode and omits
 * them on the PUBLIC team/hybrid `/health` (status-only — no topology to an
 * unauthenticated remote), while the PROTECTED `/api/diagnostics/health` surface
 * exposes the full detail in team/hybrid. {@link publicHealthDetail} is the helper
 * that strips `reasons` for the public-by-mode body so the gating is one named call.
