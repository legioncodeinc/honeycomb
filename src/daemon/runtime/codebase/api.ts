/**
 * The `/api/graph/*` mount seam — PRD-014 daemon-assembly wiring (CONVENTIONS §11).
 *
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * `mountGraphApi(daemon, { storage, ... })` is the single named step the composition
 * root (`assemble.ts`) calls AFTER `createDaemon(...)` to attach the codebase-graph
 * BUILD + READ handlers onto the already-mounted `/api/graph` route group — mirroring
 * `mountMemoriesApi` (`memories/api.ts`) and `mountDashboardApi`. ZERO edits to
 * `server.ts`: the `/api/graph` group is ALREADY scaffolded there behind the permission
 * middleware (`ROUTE_GROUPS`: `protect: true, session: false`), so attaching via
 * `daemon.group("/api/graph")` inherits auth/RBAC with no re-wiring.
 * ════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 *
 * ── What it wires (replacing the PRD-004 501 scaffold) ───────────────────────
 *   POST /api/graph/build → run the EXISTING, tested worker end-to-end: resolve the
 *                           identity tuple → `buildAggregateSnapshot` (discover →
 *                           tree-sitter extract → aggregate) → `finalizeSnapshot`
 *                           (resolve cross-file → degrees → canonical hash) →
 *                           `writeSnapshotAtomic` (local on-disk authoritative copy) →
 *                           `pushSnapshot` (best-effort cloud push to the `codebase`
 *                           table through the daemon, the ONLY DeepLake client, with
 *                           the 014c SELECT-before-INSERT drift semantics). Returns the
 *                           build result as data — NO MORE 501.
 *   GET  /api/graph        → load the freshest LOCAL snapshot for the worktree and
 *                           return the FULL dashboard {@link GraphView}
 *                           (`{ built, nodes, edges }`) the canvas renders — mapping the
 *                           NetworkX node-link `nodes`/`links` into the view-model shape.
 *                           `built:false` with empty arrays when no build has run yet.
 *                           This is the SINGLE owner of `GET /api/graph` (the dashboard's
 *                           former DeepLake-read handler is retired): reading the LOCAL
 *                           snapshot makes the PRD-041a "Build graph" re-read immediate +
 *                           consistent (no DeepLake eventual-consistency flap — the local
 *                           copy `POST /build` writes via `writeSnapshotAtomic` IS the read).
 *
 * ── Daemon-only storage (codebase CONVENTIONS §10) ───────────────────────────
 * The cloud push runs daemon-side through the injected {@link StorageQuery}; the
 * build/extract/discovery touch ONLY the local filesystem. The local snapshot is ALWAYS
 * authoritative and a push failure NEVER fails the build (014c best-effort).
