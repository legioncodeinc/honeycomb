/**
 * Inference-backed ModelClient factory — PRD-026 AC-T (the daemon-assembly seam
 * that turns the inference router into a 006 {@link ModelClient}).
 *
 * Daemon assembly (a Wave-1c bee owns `assemble.ts`) injects a {@link ModelClient}
 * into every pipeline stage + the pollinating runner. Wave 1 of PRD-010 left a
 * documented TODO: swap `noopModelClient` for `new RouterModelClient(router)` once a
 * real transport + config + secret resolver exist. This factory IS that swap,
 * packaged so the assembly bee calls ONE function:
 *
 *   const model = await buildInferenceModelClient({ scope, secretsStore, config });
 *
 * It constructs the real {@link createSecretResolver} + the real Anthropic
 * {@link createAnthropicTransport} + {@link createInferenceRouter}, and returns a
 * {@link RouterModelClient} typed as the 006 {@link ModelClient}. When NO inference
 * config is present/parseable, it returns {@link noopModelClient} — it NEVER throws.
 * A daemon without inference configured runs recall on lexical fallback and pollinating
 * is simply unavailable (the runner's no-op model yields an empty completion, which
 * the defensive parser turns into a zero-mutation pass — never a failed job).
 *
 * ── Why a string OR a path for `config` ──────────────────────────────────────
 * The assembly bee may already hold a resolved {@link InferenceConfig} (parsed once
 * at startup) OR only a path to `agent.yaml`. Both are accepted: a path is loaded
 * via `loadInferenceConfigFromYaml` (which returns `null` when the file or the
 * `inference:` block is absent — not an error), a resolved config is used directly.
 * Either way an empty/absent config → `noopModelClient`.
 *
 * ── Telemetry is the assembly's concern, not this factory's ──────────────────
 * The router's optional {@link RoutingHistoryStore} defaults to the no-op store
 * here. Wiring the real `history-store.ts` (which needs `storage`) is a separate
 * assembly step; this factory stays storage-free so it can be called before the
 * storage client is constructed, and a caller that wants telemetry passes a
 * `history` of its own.

 * `automatic` policy that reaches it → one workload per 006 token, all routing to the single
 * Portkey target. The account's `apiKeyRef` is `${PORTKEY_API_KEY}` so the router resolves the key
 * through the existing `${SECRET_REF}` resolver (FR-2). `model` is the vault `activeModel` (D-2);
 * Portkey's server-side config may override it. The target advertises the `chat` capability + the
 * `public` privacy tier with a large context window so the router's gates always admit it (Portkey
 * abstracts the underlying provider — the per-provider privacy-tier reasoning is intentionally
 * bypassed when Portkey is on; see the PRD privacy-tier note, flagged for security-worker-bee).
