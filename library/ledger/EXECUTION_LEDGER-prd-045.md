# EXECUTION LEDGER — PRD-045 Daemon-Wiring Close-out

> Orchestrator: `/the-smoker` · Started: 2026-06-22 · Branch: `legion/condescending-wilson-95d03a`
> Single source of truth. Survives context loss. Status values: OPEN / IN PROGRESS / DONE / VERIFIED / BLOCKED.
>
> **CRITICAL DIRECTIVE (in force):** No deferrals, no partial credit. 100% of every AC must be brought to full
> fruition. Any Bee unable to fully complete an AC must report the deferral to the orchestrator, which STOPS and
> prompts the user. Every Bee is armed with this directive.

## Definition of DONE (per criterion)
Fully implemented · proven by a passing test (live itest under the PRD-031 net where the AC says so) · nothing else
broken · no stub/mock-in-prod-path/TODO-later. Verification is a separate pass (security → quality close-out, or a
fresh read) that flips DONE → VERIFIED. Implementers do not grade their own homework.

## Sub-PRD ledger

### PRD-045a — Memory Pipeline worker (closes 006) · Owner: typescript-node-worker-bee · Model: opus
| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| a-AC-1 | `assembleDaemon` constructs + starts a pipeline worker leasing the 5 pipeline kinds; cite `assemble.ts` line. | DONE — `assemble.ts:1526-1527` build+start, `:1599` stop; `buildPipelineWorker` leases `PIPELINE_JOB_KINDS` |
| a-AC-2 | A captured turn enqueues the pipeline entry job (cite enqueue site at/around `capture-handler.ts:268-275`). | DONE — `capture-handler.ts:192` enqueuePipelineEntry; seam at `assemble.ts:628` via `attach.ts` |
| a-AC-3 | Live itest: capture → extraction produces ≥1 persisted fact/edge under the daemon scope. | DONE — `pipeline-worker.test.ts` deterministic chain proof green (3×); `pipeline-chain-live.itest.ts` token-gated (skip-safe, runs in CI) |
| a-AC-4 | The 4 previously-stub stages (decision, controlled-write, graph-persist, retention) produce real output, each tested. | DONE — fan-out chain wired; decision/controlled-write/graph-persist/retention each covered |
| a-AC-5 | Fail-soft: a pipeline job error fails the job (dead-letter), never crashes the daemon or capture path. | DONE — stage-worker→`queue.fail` (dead at maxAttempts:1); capture enqueue try/catch; boot fail-soft `assemble.ts:1528-1531` |

### PRD-045b — Retrieval shaping engine (closes 007) · Owner: retrieval-worker-bee · Model: opus
| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| b-AC-1 | Recorded decision (wire vs de-scope) with rationale lands in the sub-PRD Decisions. | DONE — Decision D-1 = **DE-SCOPE** (zero prod callers; currentness redundant via `is_deleted`+version + 008 supersede; no consumer wants confidence gate) |
| b-AC-2 | If wired: live itest proves a superseded memory is downweighted/gated on `POST /api/memories/recall`; cite phase invocation. | N/A — wire path not taken |
| b-AC-3 | If de-scoped: dead engine removed AND PRD-007 AC-2/3/4 rewritten to shipped behavior. | DONE — engine.ts/traversal/authorization/shaping/gate + tests deleted; PRD-007 AC-2/3/4 rewritten to RRF reality |
| b-AC-4 | No remaining gap between PRD-007 doc and runtime reality. | DONE — PRD-007 banner/overview/ACs reconciled, re-read verified |

### PRD-045c — Ontology linker + `/api/ontology` (closes 008) · Owner: typescript-node-worker-bee · Model: opus · Depends: 045a
| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| c-AC-1 | `inlineLinkMemory` invoked on a live write path; cite the call site (pipeline graph-persist and/or capture). | DONE — `graph-persist.ts:470` via `createGraphPersistHandler` `:521`; content forwarded through fan-out (per-turn, not capture path) |
| c-AC-2 | `mountOntologyApi` fired in `assemble.ts` (cite line); `/api/ontology/*` returns real data (no 501). | DONE — fired `assemble.ts:868` (`seams.mountOntology`), fail-soft; `ontology/api.ts` serves entities/edges/claims/assertions + proposals |
| c-AC-3 | Live itest: a captured/processed memory yields a linked entity readable via `/api/ontology`. | DONE — `ontology-surface-live.itest.ts` (gated) + deterministic assembled proof (`ontology-surface-assembled.test.ts`) |
| c-AC-4 | Append-only supersession applies on a live path; a superseded claim is observably tombstoned (not deleted). | DONE — `POST /api/ontology/proposals`→`submitProposal`→`supersedeClaim` (append+mark); active-only read filter; tested |
| c-AC-5 | Fail-soft mount + invocation (a mount/link error never crashes the daemon). | DONE — mount try/catch `assemble.ts:866-873`; reads→`[]` on non-ok; linker throw non-fatal in graph-persist |

> **045c→045d:** linker + control-plane apply use deterministic IDs + presence-probe → idempotent; 045d's pollinating runner must keep calling `submitProposal`/`supersedeClaim`/`inlineLinkMemory` (never raw inserts) → no double-write. Pollinating apply path left intact.

### PRD-045d — Pollinating-loop activation + proof (closes 009) · Owner: typescript-node-worker-bee · Model: opus · Depends: 045a, 045c
| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| d-AC-1 | Recorded default-posture decision + exact enable mechanism (env + vault) documented. | DONE — D-045d-1 stay OFF+opt-in (pipeline=primary writer, pollinating=consolidator); enable via `HONEYCOMB_POLLINATING_ENABLED` or vault `pollinating.enabled` (vault wins) |
| d-AC-2 | Token-gated live itest proves an enabled pass runs to completion (enqueue → lease → model → apply → state). | DONE — `pollinating-activation-assembled-live.itest.ts` (gated on token+key, skip-safe; flips gate via injected provider, asserts `last_pass_at` advance) |
| d-AC-3 | With pollinating OFF, `POST /api/diagnostics/pollinate` acks cleanly (`{triggered:false}`/queued), no crash. | DONE — `pollinate-trigger-assembled.test.ts` deterministic: 202 `{triggered:false,reason:"disabled"}`, nothing enqueued |
| d-AC-4 | Coordination check: pollinating apply + 045a graph-persist do not double-write the same edge. | DONE — `pollinate-coordination-nodoublewrite.test.ts`: shared stateful store, both paths + interleaved×3 → exactly one row per edge (deterministic IDs) |

### PRD-045e — Sources + Documents surface (closes 013) · Owner: typescript-node-worker-bee · Model: opus
| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| e-AC-1 | Composition root constructs the sources registry + providers resolver; cite the new `assemble.ts` wiring. | DONE — `buildSourcesApiDeps` (`sources/registry.ts:280`) called at `assemble.ts:854`, threaded via `resolveProductDataDeps`→`assemble.ts:706` |
| e-AC-2 | `mountSourcesApi` fires; `/api/sources` GET/POST/DELETE return real data (no 501), tenancy-scoped. | DONE — `product/api.ts:301-304`; GET 200 / POST 201 / DELETE 404 / no-org 400 proven |
| e-AC-3 | `POST /api/documents` ingests through the wired worker (no 501); live itest proves an ingested doc is recallable. | DONE — `mountProductDocumentsApi` (`product/api.ts:246`); 202 deterministic + recallable-chunk live itest (skip-safe) |
| e-AC-4 | At least Obsidian provider instantiated; a source round-trips add → list → sync. | DONE — Obsidian LIVE, connect→health connected; add→list→sync round-trip proven |
| e-AC-5 | Fail-soft mount; a provider/worker error never crashes the daemon. | DONE — `resolveProductDataDeps` try/catch `assemble.ts:852-859`; Discord/GitHub instantiated credential-free fail-soft |

### PRD-045f — Skillify mining worker (closes 016) · Owner: retrieval-worker-bee · Model: sonnet
| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| f-AC-1 | `assembleDaemon` constructs + starts a worker leasing `["skillify"]`; cite `assemble.ts` line. | DONE — `buildSkillifyWorker` `assemble.ts:1283`, start `:1617-1618`, stop `:1694-1696`; LEASE_KINDS=`["skillify"]` (`worker.ts:187`), foreign-job-untouched proven |
| f-AC-2 | Live itest: session-end enqueue → worker mines → append-only `skills` row lands and is readable via `/api/skills`. | DONE — `tests/integration/skillify-worker-mine-live.itest.ts` (deterministic + token-gated live), enqueue→lease→mine→writeSkill→read |
| f-AC-3 | `skillify pull` CLI verb registered + dispatches (cite verb-table entry). | DONE — verb `contracts.ts:88`; dispatch fix `storage-handlers.ts:114` routes to `POST /api/skills/pull` (⚠ route mount is 045g's job) |
| f-AC-4 | Fail-soft: a miner/model error fails the job, never crashes the daemon or capture path. | DONE — assembly try/catch `assemble.ts:1619-1623`; runOnce catch→`queue.fail` `worker.ts:308-318`, tested |

> **045f→045g handoffs (must be covered by 045g):** (1) session-start auto-pull is a **NO-OP** — fix site `src/hooks/runtime.ts:215` (`SessionStartDeps` built with no `seams`). (2) `POST /api/skills/pull` + publish routes are **not mounted** (only `GET /api/skills` live) — 045g must mount them so the CLI dispatch lands on a real endpoint. (3) merge duplicate CLI surfaces `src/cli/skill.ts` + `src/cli/skillify.ts`.

### PRD-045g — Team Skill Sharing (closes 018) · Owner: retrieval-worker-bee · Model: sonnet · Depends: 045f
| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| g-AC-1 | Publish endpoint mounted (cite the seam); `POST /api/skills/*` accepts a versioned publish (no 501). | DONE — `mountSkillPropagationApi` (`skillify/propagation-api.ts`) fired `assemble.ts:908`; `POST /` publish→`{published,version}` |
| g-AC-2 | `SessionStartDeps` built WITH the real `autoPull` seam (cite `runtime.ts:198` fix); auto-pull idempotent + fail-soft. | DONE — real seam injected `runtime.ts:191` (`createSessionStartSeams`, line had drifted from PRD's :198); time-budgeted (5s abort), kill-switch, fail-soft |
| g-AC-3 | Live itest end-to-end: workspace A mines+publishes (045f) → workspace/harness B auto-pulls on session start. | DONE — `skill-publish-autopull-e2e.itest.ts` deterministic (assembled daemon + real auto-pull) + token-gated live |
| g-AC-4 | Skill CLI verbs registered in `VERB_TABLE`; the duplicate `src/cli/skill.ts` impl removed or merged. | DONE — `skill`+`skillify` in VERB_TABLE→`buildSkillRequest`; dead `src/cli/skill.ts`+`src/cli/skillify.ts` deleted |
| g-AC-5 | Cross-harness symlink fan-out runs on pull and is idempotent. | DONE — `POST /api/skills/pull`→real pull engine→`fanOutSymlinks` into agent roots; re-pull writes 0 (decideAction), tested |

### PRD-045 index (roll-up + reconciliation) · Owner: library-worker-bee (AC-7/AC-1 docs) + close-out
| ID | Criterion | Status |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | Each of 006/007/008/009/013/016/018 has a cited runtime invocation site in `src/` (no test-only reachability). | DONE — invocation sites cited per sub-PRD (pipeline worker, recall RRF, ontology mount/linker, pollinating gate, sources mount, skillify worker, publish/auto-pull) |
| AC-2 | A captured turn observably processed by the memory pipeline (extraction produces facts), live itest (045a). | DONE — 045a |
| AC-3 | `/api/ontology/*` (045c), `/api/sources` + `/api/documents` (045e) return real data (no 501) on a real daemon. | DONE — 045c + 045e |
| AC-4 | A pollinating pass runs to completion when enabled (045d). | DONE — 045d |
| AC-5 | A session-end mines a skill (045f), published + pulled by a second workspace/harness (045g), end-to-end. | DONE — 045f + 045g e2e itest |
| AC-6 | Retrieval shaping phases on the live recall path or formally de-scoped, PRD-007 reconciled (045b). | DONE — 045b de-scope + PRD-007 reconciled |
| AC-7 | Each affected Completed PRD index carries an accurate reconciliation note; no `Status:` overstates runtime reality. | DONE — 6 Completed indexes (006/008/009/013/016/018) reconciled + 007 verified; 5 sub-PRD statuses flipped; parent index updated; no overstatement |

## Close-out
- **Security (security-worker-bee, opus):** 1 HIGH — cross-tenant BOLA on newly-live `/api/sources`+`/api/documents` (`sources/api.ts:67` trusted `x-honeycomb-org` w/o identity cross-check) → **FIXED in place** (`api.ts:84` `getRequestIdentity` guard) + regression test. All other surfaces clean; audit:sql OK; 2746 passed. Flagged pre-existing latent variant on `/api/secrets|notifications|vault` (NOT branch-introduced, out of PRD-045 scope → follow-up task).
- **Quality (quality-worker-bee):** PASS-WITH-NITS — no Blocker/High; all parent + sub ACs verified genuinely complete (invocation-site checks); ci green 2746 passed. Report: `reports/2026-06-22-qa-report.md`. Two warnings raised → user decisions below.
- **User decisions on QA warnings (2026-06-22):**
  - **W1 (document fetcher):** DONE — real SSRF-safe `createUrlDocumentFetcher` wired at `registry.ts:373`; fetched body ingested (not URL string); re-audited.
  - **W2 (pipeline default-OFF):** DONE — accepted + documented (045a "Default posture & enable mechanism" + PRD-006 banner W3 fix); enable via `HONEYCOMB_PIPELINE_*` flags.
- **Security re-audit (fetcher delta, security-worker-bee, opus):** 1 CRITICAL — SSRF bypass via IPv4-mapped-IPv6 hextet form (`[::ffff:169.254.169.254]`→`::ffff:a9fe:a9fe` slipped dotted-decimal regex → metadata reachable) → **FIXED in place** (`extractMappedV4`, `url-fetcher.ts:167`) + regression tests. All 7 SSRF checks verified safe.
- **Quality re-verify (quality-worker-bee, opus):** PASS-WITH-NITS, **ready to ship**. W1 genuinely met (real body ingest + SSRF-safe), W2 accurate, Critical SSRF + High BOLA re-verified fixed. Found W3 (PRD-006 banner overstated default) → **FIXED by orchestrator**. Gate: 249 files / 2795 passed / 7 skipped, audit:sql OK.

## Ship
- **PR:** [honeycomb#82](https://github.com/legioncodeinc/honeycomb/pull/82) · 5 commits on `legion/condescending-wilson-95d03a`.
- **CI (PR #82):** CodeQL flagged 2 NEW HIGH alerts in the W1 fetcher (`url-fetcher.ts bytesToText`): `js/bad-tag-filter` (whitespace/unclosed end tags leaked script/style) + `js/double-escaping` (`&amp;lt;`→`<`) → **FIXED** (commit 04f7c38: `stripElement` + single-pass `decodeEntities`, +14 tests). CodeQL now **pass**.
- **CI status: GREEN** — CodeQL ✅, Analyze actions/js-ts/python ✅, Quality gate Node 22.x+24.x ✅, Secret gate ✅, Windows smoke ✅. (CodeRabbit = non-blocking AI review.)

## FINAL STATUS: all 39 criteria DONE/VERIFIED · security clean (1 High BOLA + 1 Critical SSRF + 2 High CodeQL remediated) · quality PASS · CI GREEN · PR #82 open.

### Out-of-scope follow-up (flagged, not in this PR)
- Pre-existing latent cross-tenant header-trust on `/api/secrets`, `/api/notifications`, `/api/vault` (same `headerScopeResolver` pattern as the fixed sources BOLA, but NOT newly wired by PRD-045). Spawned as a separate task for a dedicated security pass.
